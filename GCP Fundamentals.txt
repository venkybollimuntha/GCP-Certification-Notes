Monitoring Prod workloads

16. Cloud Logging --> Real time management and analysis of logs

17. Cloud Monitoring --> Monitor health, availability and performance of infrastructure, metrics

18. Cloud Trace --> Production performance bottlenecks, application latency data

19. Cloud Debugger --> Investigate the behaviour of code in production

20. Serverless services --> Cloud Run, Workflow, App Engine, Knative, Eventarc

21. Zonal Persisitent disk, Local SSD is suitable for block storage

22. Clous Storage is suitable for object storage

23. File Storage: ideal for applications running on GKE clusters

24. Google Cloud Armor
-----------------------
	- protects infrastructure and applications network and/or protocol based DDoS attacks and application attacks

25. Network Intelligence Center:
--------------------------------
	- Provides a console for Network visibility, monitoring and troubleshooting

26. Transfer Appliance :
-------------------------
	- Moving 100s of TBs to PB to GCloud

27. Cloud Storage Transfer Service --> Moving 100s of TB data to GCloud

28. Cloud Data Loss Prevention --> fully managed service can help customers discover, classify and protect the sensitive data.


Site Reliable Engineer: (SRE)
-----------------------
	Focuses on Operational and scalability problem and availability to users

29. Cloud Router --> route exchange between Cloud VPC and on-prem network

30. Traffic Director --> implementing load balancing and configuring traffic control

31. Network Conntectivity Center --> Customers to use its own network for required purposes

32. Google Private access --> which only have internal IP address

33. Database Migration Service doesnot support SQL Server DB migration.

34. Google cloud Resource Hierarchy:  Organization --> Folders --> Projects --> Resources

35. Regions--> Zones --> DataCenters

36. Support case priorities:
	P1 --> Infrastructure unusable, causing potential data integrity, revenue loss etc
	P2 --> Infrastructure performance degraded, productivity decrease, danger of revenue loss
	P3 --> Business impact is low, no-user visible impact
	P4 --> Buiness impaact or techinical business is low to null

37. Cloud Storage --> Publicly stored objects are cached in the Cloud Storage Network by default

38. Vertex AI helps build, deploy and scale ML models faster within a unified AI platform

39. Cloud Translation helps build multilingual applications with the help of machine traslation

40. Natural Languagge AI --> classify unstructure data and performs sentiment analysis

41. Apigee sense helps protects APIs from
	- Unwanted reqeust traffic
	- Suspicious client requests
	- Data crawling
42. Bare metal solution helps customers run a specialized load, including third party virtualization and applications running low level access

43. Modes of operation in GKE are Standard, Predefined, AutoPilot

44. Google Infrastructure Security Layers:
	Operational Security --> Internet communication --> Storage Services --> User Identity --> Service Deployment --> Hardware Infrastructure
