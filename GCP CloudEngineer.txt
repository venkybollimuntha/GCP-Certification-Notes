  
  **********************   Service Account ~~~ Role  ************************

  Managed Instance group ---> target groups in ALB
  Activity logs ---> CloudTrail logs
  VM --> EC2
  GCP --> S3
  Service account --> Role



1. GCloud command is Hierarchial 
	gcloud compute instances list

2. gcloud compute instances creat --manchine-type=n1-standard-4 venky-server-1
	by default machine_type os n1-standard-1 where 1 is vCPUs

3. gcloud container clusters create venky-instance --num-nodes=4

4. gsutil mb (make bucket) command to create a new bucket in cloud storage

5. NACL rules, the large will be the number, low will be the priority. the lowest priority will ensure that the other rules that match will apply.

(Largest number should be selected to make the priority lowest)

6. You can expand the IP address using command, but no command to decrease subnet length
	gcloud compute networks subnets expand-ip-range venky-subnet --prefix-lenght=12

7. GCR is a service used to store container images instead of code

8. Cloud Source Repository --> like google own github service

9. Cloud Pub/Sub is a fully managed real time messaging service that allows you to send and receive messages between independent applications at virtually any scale and even HIPPA compliance

10. Cloud Run:  (Managed Serverless)
--------------
 Managed compute platform that automatically scales your stateless containers

11. Cloud Function: (computing service that runs code in response to events)

12. Master node is created by GKE automatically.

13. Google Deploy Manager supports Jinja2 and Python


Practice Test 2:
---------------
1. The service account user role (iam.ServiceAccountUser) for ALL service accounts in a PROJECT can be granted at the PROJECT level

Service Account Role (iam.ServiceAccountUser) --> specific service --> Service ACCOUNT level

2. The startup script is executed every time an instance is started.

3. Reserves 4 IP address in a subnet
	i) network address
	ii) default gateway
	iii) future use
	iv) broadcast address

4. You cannot clone/replicate the project in GCP

5.  BigQuery --> RDS
	BigTable --> NoSQL
	Firestore --> NoSQL
	Datastore --> NoSQL MongoDB
	GCS --> only for Files


6. BigQuery export option is available in Billing console

7. SSL Proxy load balancing is a revers proxy load balancer

8.  Regional --> Highest Expensive class
	Standard --> costliest Storage, frequent access
	Nearline --> data access was required on monthly basis
	coldline --> accessing very rarely (once per 90 days)

9. CloudSQL is used to launch MySQL or Postgres databse
	Marketplace provides you with pre-built images which can be launched with just few clicks without any configuration

10. API Library is Standard GCP library to interact Google services

11. App Engine Standard --> ElasticBeanstalk (PHP, Python, Java, Ruby, Go, .NET, nodeJS)
	App Engine Flexible --> ElasticBeanstalk (for all other languages)

12. usin --no-promote flag while deploying new version of app will not automatically send traffic to new version

13. Auto mode VPC can be converted to manual but vice versa is not possible

14. GKE:
--------
	Pod : group of containers
	StatefulSet: if a container dies, replacement one will have the same hostname and IP address
	DaemonSet: making sure that one pod is always running on each node and scales automatically.
	ReplicaSet: making sure that a desired number of pods are running.

15. VM instances by default have read access to GCS

16. while quering metadata of an instance you must provide header "Metadata-Flavor":"Google"

17. If you want to change the machine type for cluster, you MUST create a new node pool in the same cluster and migrate the work load to the new pool

18.
